**Note:**
This repository is for easier understanding of the above networks. Therefore, you should use official source cods if provided.

Setup
---

### Anaconda

By Anaconda, you can easily setup the environment using `environment.yml`.

```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Pip

If you use `pip` or other tools, see the dependencies in [`environment.yml`](./environment.yml)

Run
---

This repo uses `hydra` to manage hyper parameters in training and evaluation. See [`configs`](./configs) folder to check the parameters for each network.

```shell
$ python main.py network=glow run.distrib=ggd +run.beta=0.5 +run.dim=2

```

**Note:**
Currently, I tested the networks only for 2D density transformation. So, results for 3D densities (`swiss` and `s_curve`) and images (`mnist` and `cifar10`) could be what you expect.

Results
---

See [`results/README.md`](./results/README.md) for more results.
